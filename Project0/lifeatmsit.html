        <h2 >Life At MSIT</h2>
        <p>
            Got Tremendous Experience through MSIT. Learning by Doing helped me a lot in gaining large amount of knowledge regarding Information Technology.Due to Competitive Programming my coding capability has increased.In Addition to IT, Soft Skills also helped me a lot in exposing myself and in developing my own personality.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the innovative experiences in MSIT is the Almini Engage where Aluminis will be sharing their own carrier experiences with us which helps us a lot in building our career.

        <h2 style="color:crimson; text-align:left">My experience on the Courses</h2>
        <body>As a Mechanical student, I felt very difficult to study the courses in the starting days.
            Gradually, I got intrest on the programming languages and started learning them.
            I felt every course is important for working in the IT industry. I learnt how to 
            adapt to the new technologies.
